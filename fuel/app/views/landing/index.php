			<h3>The Difference</h3>
			<div>
				<div class="text_list">
					<div class="text_box">
						<h6>1</h6>
						<h4>Commitment to Legal Help</h4>
						<p>When people call an attorney, they don’t want to speak to a person who is not an attorney about their case specifics. We don’t believe in putting any barriers between your case and the lawyer that will be representing you.  When you call into the firm, you will speak with or receive a call back from a licensed attorney.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="text_box">
						<h6>2</h6>
						<h4>Commitment to Personal Service</h4>
						<p>Choosing an attorney is a very important decision. People come to attorneys in times of need and deserve personal attention and time.  No matter what the legal matter is, we work with our clients to deliver service that is not typical of a law firm.  Our firm is built on our clients’ satisfaction, and we want to be a law firm you are proud to have representing you in all your times of need.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="text_list">
					<div class="text_box">
						<h6>3</h6>
						<h4>Commitment to Excellence</h4>
						<p>Legal work demands an eye for detail, an in-depth understanding of the law and how it can be appropriately applied.  Whether it’s in writing or in front of a judge and jury, our firm will provide the in depth and thorough analysis and arguments that even the most demanding judges respond to.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="text_box">
						<h6>4</h6>
						<h4>Commitment to Communication</h4>
						<p>One of the most frustrating elements for legal clients is a lack of communication.  We take tremendous pride in making sure all of our clientele are thoroughly communicated with on all relevant issues pertaining to their case.  Don’t spend your time worrying about the unknown.  You can rest easy knowing that you have a competent attorney working for you.</p>

				<p>Should you wish to retain our services, we work out a retainer and the contract where you officially hire the firm to represent you.  Retainers and rates vary by case complexity and type.

In the event we think we can provide valuable legal service to you, the consultation will then entail us explaining the formation of the attorney-client relationship, should you choose to engage the firm: the representation agreement. In that agreement, we lay out all the terms of our representation for you. We explain what our fees are, what your rights are, how and when we bill for our time and other relevant details to the attorney-client relationship. We will explain all the clauses so you understand how the attorney-client relationship will unfold.  

<span class="italic">You have now hired the firm!</span>
